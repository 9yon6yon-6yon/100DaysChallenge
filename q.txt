2. Translate the requirements given below, into correct executable
Java code.
• Create a package. The package name will be your own first
name. Under this package, create an interface, named B,
which will contain only one integer variable, initialized
with the last three digits of your own student id.
• Create another package. The package name will be your
own last name. Under this package create an interface,
named A. This interface will inherit from interface B. It will
contain a method header, “public void
showInformation()”. The implementation of this method
requires printing the last three digits of your own student
id using variable from interface B & your own full name.
• Under the default package, create a class named Tester.
This class will implement interface A. Provide appropriate
method body for the method named “showInformation”,
according to the requirements stated above. Create a main
method, which will create an object of class Tester and
invoke the “showInformation” method.



3. Consider you have to build an application where -
• In the main method, you take an integer input
• If the input is even number then calculate the divisors of
that number in a new thread and display “This is divisor
thread”. Also, display the divisors of that number.
• If the input number is odd, another thread will calculate
the factorial of that number and display “This is factorial
thread”. Also, display the factorial of that number.
Now write a java program that will satisfy the above conditions.
